Meloma v1.3 is a patch for Max/MSP for didactic purposes in the application and experimentation with the concept of meloma. It is a program aimed at composers, researchers in music, mainly texture and form, and those interested in understanding Partitional Analysis and its derived theories. Its applications include:

- Analysis of linear texture
- Experimentation with creation of melodies.

Version 1.3 is in the testing phase, and we offer it as an open-source program.

# Basic Instructions
Meloma has a simple interface, where the only method of input is through a MIDI keyboard. When playing sequences of pitches, the program provides the corresponding linear operator and displays the number of lines on the panel to the right. The pitches of the linear vector (linvector) are listed in the upper field.

# Download and Installation
To install Meloma v1.3 on Windows or Mac OS, download the file Melomav13 and run on Max-MSP.

Max-MSP is offered by Cycling (https://cycling74.com/) free for 30 days. After the evaluation period, Max-MSP can be used as a runtime for patches, including Meloma.
